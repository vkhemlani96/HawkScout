 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * new CountDownTimer(30000, 1000) {
 *
 *     public void onTick(long millisUntilFinished) {
 *         mTextField.setText("seconds remaining: " + millisUntilFinished / 1000);
 *     }

 *         mTextField.setText("done!");
 *     }
 *  }.start();
 * </pre>
 *
 * The calls to {@link #onTick(long)} are synchronized to this object so that
 * one call to {@link #onTick(long)} won't ever occur before the previous
 * callback is complete.  This is only relevant when the implementation of
 * {@link #onTick(long)} takes an amount of time to execute that is significant
 * compared to the countdown interval.
